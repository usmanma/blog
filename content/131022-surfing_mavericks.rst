Surfing Mavericks

:date: 2013-10-22

So today was meant to be for starting of challenge app. 

As usual, distractions were aplenty and so I never got round to it. 

Today was the release of Mavericks_, and with a price tag of free, it was hard 
to resist. As a result I spent most of the day backing up, formatting and fresh 
installing it.

Setup
=====

First thing to do is download Mavericks from the App Store.

Then simply install it.

Some tips that might be useful:

Disable Dashboard
    To disable the dashboard, type this in terminal::
        defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES && killall Dock
