Technology Stack

This blog has finally gotten off the ground, so for the first entry, I thought I would
list the technology being used by it (more for personal memory reasons).

Pelican
	`Pelican`_ is a `python`_ based static site generator. This is what does all the
	magic. The source code can be found on my `github`_ in the `blog`_ repository.

Bootstrap
	`Bootstrap`_ is a front-end framework that makes design easy even for developers.

Theme: Asterias
	The theme is custom made on top of simple, and happens to be what you are currently
	looking at. The name asterias is simply the code name for this blog project and hence
	it is named after that. The theme needs a lot of work still but currently its purpose
	is to serve as a book style site. Due to this limited requirement, it does not make
	full use of articles, categories or tags that Pelican provides.

Bootstrap Icon Plugin
	This is a custom plugin to make it easier to include bootstrap icons with in
	documents. This is also available on `github`_ under the `pelican-bootstrap-icon`_ 
	repository.
